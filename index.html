        <h4>Project Background</h4>
        <p>
          The bicycle production industry in Europe is facing significant
          challenges, as reflected by a 5.26% decrease in bicycle sales profits
          from 2015 to 2016. This change marks a reversal from the previous
          trend, where between 2014 and 2015, there was an 11.56% increase in
          bicycle sales profits. This sharp decline serves as a significant
          signal of a shift in consumer behavior or other factors affecting the
          bicycle industry in Europe. <br />Through the use of an interactive
          dashboard, visitors and stakeholders can gain a better understanding
          of market dynamics, sales trends, and factors influencing bicycle
          sales in Europe. Besides visualizing bicycle sales data patterns from
          year to year through interactive graphs and diagrams, we also provide
          conclusions and offer relevant recommendations to support
          decision-making for bicycle industry stakeholders in Europe.

            To increase our profit by 5-11%, we need to focus on specific
            countries, product categories, and customer age ranges that can make
            a significant contribution to increased profitability. Because when
            the focus is on a specific target, we can reduce the unit cost and
            gain more profit. We also should focus on our engagement to increase
            our profit.

            In 2012, the United States achieved the highest profit, with products in
